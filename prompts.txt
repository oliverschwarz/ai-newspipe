# Start
I would like to write a python application. I do not know python and I want to learn it. However, I know other programming languages as well. The application will be running on macos and should grab the content from different RSS news feeds, push it to the OpenAI API to check for news on the topic of AI, machine learning and LLM, summarizes the response into markdown format and store it in a local file. In the end I want to run the application every morning so that I have the actual news around AI locally in a markdown file to publish where ever I like. The project should have the following conditions:
Test-driven development: I want to use pytest from the beginning to validate the quality and function of my application

# Not so fast
I forgot the name of the project: It will be 'ai-newspipe'. And probably this was a little bit to fast for me, nonetheless impressive, thanks. Let me quickly implement all your suggestions and I come back to you.

# Understood. Continue ... but what about git and virtual environments
Okay, back to the start and the setup. I have the code in a git repository checked out as a local project (in which I am working). Should I create my virtual environment there? Or should I better use a deployment to another directory to work there in a virtual environment? If I use it there directly for developing, I don't want to accidentally commit it to my repos.

# Argh ... all those python comments. But how do I comment correctly
How do I comment in python? I see different ways. How do I comment file-wide and inline? Can I tag comments or files?

# Thanks ... but what are __init__.py files for?
Thanks, that's great to know. Could you tell me what the "init.py" files are for?

# Now back to work
Okay, let's get back to the initial setup: I have created a virtual environment, excluded it from git and run the initial test successful for the first time and documented every step. Now let's move on. What now?

# First (expected) error
No questions, understood. However, of course my tests fail now with "ImportError while importing test module '/Users/oliverschwarz/dev/ai-newspipe/tests/test_feed_reader.py'." There is no module yet, so this was expected. Now let's move on.

# Add URL handling and structure returned content
Let's first add validation for URLs and then the method to fetch RSS content. Then we should structure this content. I would like to keep title, description, publishing date, link and the url of the rss feed for later usage.

# Some tiny additions
I have two requests: Can I create a verbose output to document what is being done by the script? Example: I would like to check eventually, which feeds are called, which results were coming back. Secondly: Please add the feed title to the feedparser's structured response for each feed.

# Now to the sources of the RSS urls
Okay, next step for me is store the RSS Urls in a separate file each in a single line. Then parse the file and fetch the URLs and then trigger the feedparser to fetch all the feeds to return them all in one structured content. I expect that the parsing of the source file with the URLs and the feedparser should be separated components. How are we going to put them together. Please start by adding tests for file parsing, then determine the source of the RSS URLs (in a file called news_sources.txt) and then explain to me how we will put the functionality together in a python manner - and how we are going to test it all end to end.

# Get going with ChatGPT
Okay, let's get going again. I just talked to ChatGPT about the format that would help the most to summarize news and it's JSON. So what we need to do now is to parse the feed response into JSON format, push it to the OpenAI api, write a good prompt with requirements for summarizing and highlighting and take the response again to store it in the MD file. I think, Markdown creation can be done by ChatGPT, so we can include that in the prompt.

# Too large of a request
Okay, the request is too large for the ChatGPT API. We should restrict the fetched news to dates from today and yesterday and discard all news that are older than 2 days. Let's see how many entries we get then before sending them to the API.

# Too complex code
Uuuuh lots of errors. Probably with the parse_date function. How should we go on? We could try to fix the multiple errors or we can just restrict the rss feeds by the 3 most actual entries (which is much more simple than the date parsing). The error occurs after parsing the 2nd feed with '2024-11-22 13:27:27 - src.feed_reader - ERROR - Error fetching feed https://blog.google/technology/ai/rss/: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes"

# Request still too large
Okay, there's still too much payload for ChatGPT. The API responses with: Request too large for gpt-4 in organization org-SckeNQ4QZAbdySV3jzSmbtCk on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 10000, Requested 13396. The input or output tokens must be reduced in order to run successfully. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/rate-limits to learn more"
Please come up with some ideas. Maybe we have to introduce date parsing again. I really just want to have the news from today. We could skip all feeds that do not have news from today. Before you write code now, let's discuss about the options. What possible solutions do you come up with?

# Aaaaand date parsing again
Well these are some great ideas, thanks. We will try the following first:
* Truncate description length to 200 chars
* Remove feed_url data - we already have the title
* Introduce date parsing again and only process today's entries and use feedparser's built-in parsed dates: Only allow today's items (could be, that a lot of feeds return no entries then - which is good)
